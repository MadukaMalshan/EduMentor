EduMentor is a lightweight educational website project designed to provide an online learning experience with features like an interactive chat interface, an online library section, and informational pages (About Us, Contact). It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to understand, customize, and expand for learning platforms or personal portfolio projects.

This repository includes essential front-end components such as static pages and client-side scripts that demonstrate core web development concepts. Whether you are learning web technologies or planning to build a full-fledged educational platform, EduMentor serves as a practical starting point and foundation for further enhancements (e.g., user authentication, backend integration, real-time features).
